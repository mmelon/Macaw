How to - Duplicate my element easily in Macaw - (snippet) + (example file)

Hi everyone,
Scarlet is really promising but still in beta and we mustn't forget that Macaw is still very powerful, that's why I'm going to update some threads and add more files.

On major flaw in Macaw is that it doesn't allow us to create dynamic elements and the only solution so far was to copy/paste them. By doing that, each time you modify your original object you must apply them on every copy and you augment the possibility to add a new property by mistake… forcing Macaw to create a new class in your CSS. And by repeating the same objects you ask Macaw to do some heavy maths that can sometimes make the poor bird sick ;).

Here is my solution for keeping my file lighter and the CSS cleaner, a <b>clone script</b>. Like that you can design only one of your element and clone it to see the result, a more HTML approach.
The downside is that you wont be able to see the final result of your work inside Macaw without publishing (not entirely).


<u>Here's the file</u>:
<b>http://cl.ly/dWXy</b>


<u>Here's the really basic script</u>:

<code>$(document).ready(function() {
  var $articles = $('.article');
  // shots list (11+1 img)
  for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    $articles.clone().insertAfter($articles);
  }
  // here's where you can add the rest of the code for modyfing the content of the clones
});</code>

<u>Explanation</u>:
_<b>.article</b> is the class of the element I want to duplicate,
_<code>for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    $articles.clone().insertAfter($articles);
  }</code> is the loop that will duplicate your element. You need to minus the one you already created with Macaw (in my example I want 12, so I create 11 new ones).

Duplicating an object is good but generally don't reflect the result you want, so you can add a <b>second part to that script for modifying the content of each one of the clones</b>.


<u>Example for a list of images</u>:

<code>var img_list = [
    "https://unsplash.it/500?image=10",
</code>…
<code>"https://unsplash.it/500?image=120",
  ];
    $.each(img_list, function(i, value) {
      $(".shots--li img").eq(i).attr("src", value);
  });</code>

<u>Explanation</u>:
_<b>img_list</b> is the list of my external images. Currently urls but you can add your local files, like <code>"../img/image.png"</code>.
<i><u>Note</u>: in that case do not forget that <b>img.png</b> is on the same level as your <b>.mcw</b>. In that case you must open your index.html manually, preview and remote preview won't load those images.</i>

If you need to modify some texts replace <code>$(".shots--li img").eq(i).attr("src", value);</code> by <code>$(".element").eq(i).html(value);</code>

<u>Example for a list of title</u>:

<code>var title_list = [
    "Scarlet is so good, I\'m crying rainbows each time I open it.",
</code>…
<code>"Scarlet will be the next \"App of the Year\" 2016!",
  ];
    $.each(title_list, function(i, value) {
    	$(".element__title").eq(i).attr("src", value);
  });</code>

<i><u>Note</u>: if you need to add a <b>"</b> in one of your title add a <b>\</b> before it, like that</i> <code>\"</code>.

That's all for that clone script!
<i>It surely needs a rewriting but it works fine without being too complicate so I stay with that version for now. Meanwhile if you want to arrange it (with arrays), do not hesitate! :)</i>
