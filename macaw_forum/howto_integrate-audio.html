Since this is working - similar as it does in plain HTML5 - I thought I would give it a try with audio.

I added a folder "audio", which contains a file "artist - song.mp3", next to the existing "video" folder.
Next I created a new embed element div.audio and added the following content:

 <code><audio controls>
  <source src="..audio/artist - song.mp3"  type="audio/mp3">

 </audio></code>

After publishing the page the (grey) audio controls appear in the browser but nothing can be played. While the video's play fine...


The audio can be played if I place the specific audio file in the folder that contains the HTML file and if I change the code to:

<code><audio controls>
  <source src="artist - song.mp3"  type="audio/mp3">

 </audio></code>


Question: Why can't audio files be treated the same way as video files, with their own folder at the .mcw level...  or am I doing something terribly wrong?  TIA...
