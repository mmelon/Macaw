<h2>Macaw</h2><br>
Tom made several video tutorials on Macaw. They now are a bit old, the interface has changed a bit since, but the technique is still interesting and relevant.
Note: the viewport tool was in the beta version of Macaw and don't exist anymore (you don't have to resize anything since it's now automatic) - read more about <a href="http://docs.macaw.co/#canvas">canvas</a>.
