Since I'm one of the moderator of the official [forum of Macaw](http://forum.macaw.co) I oftenly tried to help some users of Macaw who can sometimes stuck on simple things by giving them some example files.
It's because [Macaw](http://macaw.co) looks like a graphic app but the element you draw inside of it act like web objects, and that can be surprising for the new designer who's trying to design its first website by himself.

Despite the fact that the team sell its app as the image editor which can design and code website… I prefer to say that Macaw is best used to design quick wireframes or small prototypes.
Sure, it can be use for designing an entire website but for that we must work around some serious limitations… it's a bit outside the box and Macaw loses its value.
Note that I also noticed that Macaw helped a lots of users to better understand how HTML and CSS works (thanks to its awesome UI).

Here, you'll find some ready to use components, snippets, example files or even full templates.

If you have a specific problem, ask me directly in the [forum](http://forum.macaw.co) or on [twitter](https://twitter.com/ngenty).

Have fun with Macaw!
