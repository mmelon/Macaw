<h1>Known issues</h1>

<b>Preview error (-302)</b>
Preview use a really poor and basic browser so some external functions won't work.
It does not work in the preview window of Macaw. Open your page in a browser and check it there. That should work.


<b>Stuck on publishing</b>
If Macaw seems to stuck when you're publishing your work it can says that you didn't follow those basic rules:
- remember that Macaw isn't a graphic app
- learn some basic HTML/CSS
- group your elements as needed
- name them correctly (<a href="http://forum.macaw.co/discussion/comment/6231/#Comment_6267">help</a>)
- publish regularly and do some change if needed
- read: http://forum.macaw.co/discussion/comment/7095/#Comment_7095

<b>Why my font hover doesn't work?</b>
Often
Macaw doesn't ask Google font for the right hover weight:
<code>http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Oswald:300</code>
whereas it should be:
<code>http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Oswald:300,400</code>

Problem, when you ask for a bolder font without the right font face file means you ask the browser to apply a <b>faux bold</b> (<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/say-no-to-faux-bold">help</a>).
In your case, Oswald 300 and Oswald 400 is understood by your browser as Oswald regular font weight (<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/fonts.html#font-boldness">help</a>)

Now, you can bypass this “limitation” by asking google for the right font weight just by adding:
<code><link href="http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Oswald:400" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"></code>
in your Head & Tail section (or just create a new text object in your design with the right font weight on its normal state).


<b>Float right bug</b>
<img src="http://cl.ly/YGK8/macaw_float-right.png" alt="macaw float right">
Macaw doesn't handle very well the float right. It's known and we can't do anything at the moment, aside sending bug report.

<b>Float stuck</b>
Happens when you're mixing different static positions on the same level. Try to stick to one position and group your elements when you want to change it.
Note, mixing static and absolute is not a problem here (only for static left/center/right).

In ths example he just have drag'n drop div.center on section.blades for repairing the file.

<b>Optimize image uncheck</b>
Once you've checked this option and cropped (double click) one of your image, you won't be able to disable it unless you reset that image.

Generate Optimized Images option allows you to <b>crop</b> your image and to generate a new image for you.

Now in your case, you already used that option on some img and on many breakpoints so you can't uncheck it.
For that you must reset each image on each breakpoint where you used that option (see your image folder for pointing them out for you).
When you'll reset them, it's totally normal that some of them will break  your design. Readjust your design by resizing your images.
Once you've done that you'll be able tu uncheck that option.

Reminder:
- Double click on an image = cropping (if the Generate Optimized Images option is checked).
- Resizing your image by dragging its corner = set a size for you image only in your CSS.
