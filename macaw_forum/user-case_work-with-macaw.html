From Summer https://visualoutcasts.ro/en/home/
I'm at my third site done in Macaw. So far I have encountered the fewest bugs. What I did (compared to the other sites I previously did in Macaw - which was horrible because of all the bugs) is the following. I start with the design of the header and footer at the highest breakpoint and when I'm happy with it and feel that it is the final version, I start a new Macaw document and do it all again clean (no undos, everything grouped as fast as possible and locked when it's finished) and start doing the other breakpoints. After that, I make a backup and continue working on the other design elements. On the site I am currently working I have done about 16 pages so far and I am quite happy with the Macaw workflow (no instant shut downs, no publishing problems just about 3 bugs that disappeared by themselves after a restart of Macaw).
