<h1>FAQs</h1>
<br><br>
<b>Where can I find more informations on Macaw?</b>
Please read the official docs first (http://docs.macaw.co/),
and you’ll find more links here: <a href="http://forum.macaw.co/discussion/1682/tutorials-videos-and-free-resources">Tutorials, Videos and Free Resources</a>.

<b>Do I need to learn HTML and CSS first?</b>
It would be better to know some basics but you can use it without any knowledge if you read first the docs and some tutorials.
Same as Photoshop, sure you can design a flyer without any knowledge but I wish you good luck when you'll need to print it.
Don't forget that Macaw is ruled by HTML and CSS standards and you must be aware of their existences.
A simple course like “<a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web">Learn to code HTML & CSS</a>" on <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> can really help you to better understand how to work with Macaw.

<b>What is the difference between licences?</b>
There’s two licences, a “Pro" and a “<a href="http://macaw.co/learners/">Learner</a>".
Both do the same but “Learner" licences are for students only.
It’s an honor based system, it means its up to you to buy the right licence.
Since Macaw can really accelerate your workflow you should respect it and participate financially in the development of this revolutionary app.

<!Best use of Macaw:

Macaw is really good by making wireframes/prototyping and it means you should use it without importing too much things. You should use it with fake light elements (like http://placehold.it) and replace them after publishing.
Now, If you really want to make all your work within Macaw and export a finished product, it's your right and happily you can! But you should try to optimize all your assets before importing them. Also try to use svgs when you can (for icons, logos).

I know that Macaw should handle all your files the same way as Photoshop but that's not the case at this time.
M acaw handles your file the same way your browser do, so if you're using large jpg or png and hundred of graphic files the performance will be really bad !

you must carefully prepare your assets (images, icons etc.) before you import them into Macaw. Importing 2-3mb image files is not what you would want to do (even if performance was not an issue you shouldn't import such large image files).

Macaw have some difficulties: when you never rename your elements OR when you rename them with the same name but with different styles.
In others words, when you leave Macaw do your job (yes, it is), you must expecting some slow downs.

Another quick remark, Macaw is an hybrid app, it's based on chromium and at this time you'll never have the same performance as a native app.

<b>Linux version</b>
Not yet and perhaps never.
But because Macaw is built on frameworks compatible with Linux we can say that it’s possible. It mostly depends on the team will and most importantly on the users needs. You must understand that the team won't work a few weeks on a version who's wanted by a few.
You can read Adam’s tweet about it: https://twitter.com/gesusc/status/503902581157298177

<b>Mobile-first</b>
The actual version of Macaw is desktop-first only.
First screens of Scarlet (next major version) showed us that it would be surely available.

<b>Bugs</b>
Lots of “bugs" are often just a misuse of Macaw by the users. See <a href="http://forum.macaw.co/discussion/1682/tutorials-videos-and-free-resources">Tutorials, Videos and Free Resources</a>.

<b>Where can I download an older version of Macaw?</b>
Mac users can find older versions here: http://download.macaw.co/appcast.xml
I don’t know the link for the Win users (pm me if you know it).

<b>Are the components dynamics?</b>
No, your components are just reusable elements but they're not dynamics. It means, in case you used several of them in your page and needs to apply some change, you'll need to modify each one of them.

<b>What’s the meaning of nudge and pudge?</b>
Nudge: “a light touch or push” = Move

<b>What is a .mcw?</b>
A mcw file is a zip folder composed of all your assets in a folder and a .json file.

<b>Can I retrieve all my assets from a mcw file?</b>
Yes! Because an mcw file is just a zipped folder you can unzip it and be able to see all of your assets used in your project.

From brandon:
At the moment, you can delete an existing image from the Library and it will warn you if that image is being used in any elements. Then if you upload another image with the exact same name, the images will be updated. You may need to reopen your project after replacing the image for the elements to display them. Make sure you're using the latest version of Macaw (1.5.8+) as this wasn't possible a few versions ago.
Another technic:
If you are on a Mac, you can change the suffix of your ".mcw" file to ".zip" and open it. There you find a folder "assets". In that you can swap your new image with the existing one, meaning you'll over write it. But of course you have to use the exact same name. Then you re-zip your "project"- folder, change the suffix back to ".mcw". The folder changes to a file Icon, the one of your "mcw" file. Now you can open it with Macaw. Your new image will be in place of the old one.
