my settings/workflow for having usable CSS file

<u><b>My Settings</b></u> (Shift+CMD+P):

<b>Pages</b>:
[X] Consolidate Page Styles (for a multiple page website)

<b>Styles</b>:
[X] Consolidate Style
[X] Shorthand Properties
<span style="color:#6A6A6A">[ &nbsp;] Tag Selectors</span>
<span style="color:#6A6A6A">[ &nbsp;] Advanced Selectors</span>
<span style="color:#6A6A6A">[ &nbsp;] Trim Whitespace</span>
[X] Add Browser Prefixes  (perhaps your front-dev will ask you to deactivate it - /!\ in that case watch out the preview mode)

<b>Grids</b>:
<span style="color:#6A6A6A">[ &nbsp;] Publish Grids</span>

<b>Images</b>:
<span style="color:#6A6A6A">[ &nbsp;] Generated Optimized Images</span>

<u><b>My Workflow</b></u>:
I'm using this useful snippet for creating some dynamic elements on my page: http://forum.macaw.co/discussion/1500/trick-include-for-macaw-insert-the-content-of-one-file-into-another-one

Like that I can design my navigation on one page, my contact form/footer/etc. on another. After that I build my pages around their content without redesigning all of the different blocks (note, there is always some negative points, but it works).

Then I import my work in some front dev tool like Hammer/Mixture/etc. and optimize/enhance it on code editor… no need if you have the help of a front-dev.
Your CSS is already good, your HTML too (without the whole HEAD code). You can ask your dev if he will agree to work with some file like that… ;)
